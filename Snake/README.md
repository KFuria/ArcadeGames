The snake game is a simple arcade game where a player controls a snake in a playing field, collecting food which make the snake grow in size while avoiding the walls and the snake's own body.

It first appeared in the Nokia 6110 cellular phones in 1998.

This game is made using C and SDL2.  

###Gameplay:
    – The player controls the snake that continually moves forward.
    – It can be moved in four directions within a playing field, however the snake can only turn 90deg at a time. 
    – The goal is to collect the randomly spawning food that increases the length of the snake.
    – Colliding with a wall or the body of the snake ends the game. 
    – The score will increment every time the snake eats the food.

###Player Inputs:
    – The player should be able to control the snake using the arrow keys
    – The player should be able to pause, resume and reset the game
    – The game should pause once ended, and the player can only continue by resetting the game. 
    – The player should be able to exit the game whenever needed.
    – Once the game ends, the score should be saved as the "last score" and reset to 0 when the player resets the game.
